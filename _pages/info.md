## Registration

* [Registration]() **LINK TBD** (The contest is open to both industry and academia.)


## Target Platform 

TBD

<!-- The 2022 contest will use the [Ultra 96 v2 development board](http://zedboard.org/product/ultra96-v2-development-board).
  
You should use the PYNQ 2.7 image, available at <http://www.pynq.io/board.html>. Direct download [link](https://bit.ly/u96v2_v2_7). 

### Legacy Ultra96v1 Support
In 2019, we used the Ultra96 v1 board. If you have this board, you may choose to continue to use it instead of purchasing a v2 board (or you may use both for your testing); however, you should be aware of the potential issues:
  * The WiFi module and the power regulators on the board have changed, which will likely result in different power usage measurements than an identical design running on the v2 board. 
  * The Ultra96v1 board typically shipped with a 2A power supply; however, if your design uses multiple software cores plus substantial amount of FPGA fabric, this may not be sufficient. A larger 4A power supply can be purchased from AVNET for $19.99. -->
